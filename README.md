# bitbucket-to-github-style

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pixbi/backend-redirect-packages.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pixbi/backend-redirect-packages)

Redirect Bitbucket-style URL to GitHub-style URL. Use this to put a facade in
front of your Bitbucket constellation of repositories but still use
Component.io which expects your repositories to be hosted on a service that
follows the GitHub-style URL.
