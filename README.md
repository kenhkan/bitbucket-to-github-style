# bitbucket-to-github-style

Redirect Bitbucket-style URL to GitHub-style URL. Use this to put a facade in
front of your [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) constellation of repositories
but still use [component.io](http://component.io/) which expects your
repositories to be hosted on a service that follows the GitHub-style URL.
